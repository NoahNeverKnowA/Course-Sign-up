The requirements of these softwares are to allow a student to register for courses and prevents them making any mistakes when doing so such as over registering, re registering
for the same course, and also registering for too many hours.

Some things I think I did perticularly well was my ability to find and solve bugs in code. I really feel I had a great undersanding of what the code was doing and what I 
needed to accomplish.

Console and WPF applications serve different needs based on their design and user interactions. Console aplications are text based and command line interfaced that focus on 
simplicity and effeciency. They are ideal for users who prefer text input and output. WPF applications feature a rich and graphical interface with buttons and all sorts of
interactive elements, enhancing user experience. 

My strategies for debugging included following the error codes with the line numbers given. Once I knew where to look It was relatively simple to spot the issue when taking a 
closer look. This is a sustainable strategy because I will always have that resource. A simple google search of my code could offer insight on what needs to be fixed with this
day and ages technological advances and assistance.

I had to be innovative when working with WPF because 1. I have never done that 2. Applications have a main window and a source code that you need to worry about. 
It's got layers like an onion. */
